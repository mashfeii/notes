## Porpositional logic

Sentences considered in propositional logicare not arbitrary sentences but are the onesthat are either true or false,
but not both. This kind of sentences are called propositions. By reading a sentence and basing your conslusion directly
from the facts mentioned in the sentence only, you can conclude the truth or falsity of the statement.

| -------------- | ----------------- |
| NOT            | $\lnot$           |
| AND            | $\land$           |
| OR             | $\lor$            |
