# Expert System

- Computer programs that utilize knowledge and inference mechanisms to provide advice, solutions, or recommendations in specialized domains
- They are designed to capture and emulate the expertise of human specialists to solve complex problems and make informed decisions
- Were formally introduced around 1965 by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by Edward Feigenbaum

## Prolog

- Theoretical Foundations
  Prolog was developed based on formal logc and mathematcal theores of compuatation
- Declarative Language
  Prolog s a declaratve language, which means you describe the problem and let the computer foure out how to solve it
- Pattern Mathing
  Prolog uses pattern mathing to compare the input with the knowledge base and find solutions to problems

### Structure

- Facts
  Facts are statements that are always true in the knowledge base, which can be used to build further relationships
  between objects
- Rules
  Rules define relationships between objects and can be used to solve problems by querying them with specific input
- Queries
