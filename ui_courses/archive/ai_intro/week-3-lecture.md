# Agents

- An agent is anything which:
  - Lives in an environment
  - Can perceive the environment via its sensors
  - Can act upon the environment via its actuators
- Agents also have memory of the current and past perceptions of the environment
  - Percept - the current state
  - Percept Sequence - the complete history of Percepts

## Humans as agents

- Envronments
  - Home
  - School
  - Work
- Sensors
  - Eyes
  - Ears
  - Mouth
- Actuators
  - Hands
  - Feet
  - Speech

## PEAS - Persomrmance Measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors

Agent through sensors gets percepts from environment and returns some action within its actuators

## Properties of the Environment

- Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable
- Single vs. Multiple Agent
- Deterministic vs. Stochastic
- Episodic vs. Sequential
- Static vs. Dynamic
- Discrete vs. Continious
- Known vs. Unknown

## Types of Agents

1. Simple reflex agents
2. Model-based reflex agents
3. Goal-based agents
4. Utility-based agents
