# Introduction

What is optimization?

- Method to minimize of maximaze certain value
- This quantity/value is expressed by a mathematical function that depends on some parameters

Why do we trudy theese kind of problems?

- Many practical applciations in different disciplines (computer science, physics, economy, ...) can be expressed as
  Optimization problems
- Human instension is not just to solve a problem, but obtain the oprtimal solution

How does Optimization work?

- Optimization problems are formulates using mathematical functions
- Criteria for existence and uniqueness of optima are derived by mathematical techniques
- Solution algorithms are iterative and approximate
  - Convergence speed and accuracy are issues

What if we know about Optimization?

- We can use these methods and techniques for all kind of engineering and scientific problems
- We can improve these methods and adapt them for special problems
