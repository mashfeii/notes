# Languages
Alphabet: $\sum = \{ a, b, c \}$
Strings: _abc_, _aaa_, _babac_
Length of word: $|\epsilon||$ = 0
Concatenation (strings multiplication): abc.bc = abcbc
Substrings: _bb_ is a substring for a*bb*c
Cleene star __(free monoid)__: all possible strings from given alphabet
$\{a,\ bb\}^{*} = \{\epsilon, a, bb, abb, bba, aaaa, \dots \}$ 

$\sum = \{a,\ b\} \\
L = \{aa,\ bb\}$
L - language over $\sum$

## FSA
Formal description: $(Q, \sum, \delta, q_0, A)$
Automata takes given string and "parses" it char by char, so it has $Q$ states (set of states), $q_0$ - initial state.
We can have "trash" or "trap" state, that loops all the chars to itself
$A$ - accepting (final) state
$\sum$ - alphabet
$\delta: Q \times \sum \mapsto Q$ - transitive functions (from state to state based on new symbol)

## FST - FSA with output
Formal description: $(Q, \sum, \delta, q_0, A, O, n)$
Where: $O$ - output alphabet, $n: Q \times \sum \mapsto O^{*}$

Example: $\sum = \{0,\ 1\}$

### Regular language - language that can be accepted by FSA
$\{a^nb^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ - non-regular language
$L_1 \cdot L_2 = \{w_1 \cdot w_2\ |\ w_1 \in L_1,\ w_2 \in L_2\}$ - languages concatenation
$L_1 \cup L_2,\ L_1 \cap L_2$ - default operations on sets (languages in this case)

## Pumping Lemma
If we have regular language $\mathbf{R} \to \exists m \in \mathbb{N}:\ \forall w \in \mathbb{R}, |w| \geq m: \exists s = xyz$
1. $|y| \geq 1$ - medium part is NOT NILL
2. $|xy| \leq m$
3. $\forall i \in \mathbb{N},\ i \geq 0,\ xyz \in \mathbb{R}$

Reverse description: $\forall m \in \mathbb{N}: \exists s \in \mathbb{R},\ |s| \geq m: \forall s = xyz: \exists i \in \mathbb{N}: xyz \notin \mathbb{R}$

## PDA (Push-Down Automata)
$(Q, \sum, \delta, q_0, A, Z_0, \Gamma)$
$Z_0$ - initial symbol in stack
$\Gamma$ - stack alphabet
$\delta: Q \times \sum \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma^{*}$

Example: $L: \{a^nb^{2n}\ |\ n \in \mathbb{N}\}$

## MID QUIZ

  It is on FSA with input and output tapes
  The translation may happen only to the accepted strings
2. Which of the following statements about FSA is/are TRUE?
  An FSA with a total transition function is called complete
  In complete FSA the number of transitions from each state matches the number of symbols in the alphabet
3. What is a context-free language?
  A language requiring on unbounded memory to be recognized
4. What is the regular language?
  A format language that can be defined by a regular expression
  A formal language that can be recognized by a finite state machine
  A format language that can be generated by a regular grammar
5. Which of the following languages require(s) unbounded emmory to be recognized?
  $L = \{a^nb^n\}$
  $L = \{a^{n!}\}$
  $L = \{wcw^R\ |\ w \in \{a,\ b\}^{*} \cap |w| > 0\}$
6. Relate the following statement: All ufficiently long words in a regular language can have a middle section of words repeated a number of times to produce a new word which also lies within the same language.
