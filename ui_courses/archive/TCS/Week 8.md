# FSA for System Design and Verification

- FSAs are also used for Software Verification (in some of their variants)
- The term **Software Model-Checking** denotes techiques to automatically verify real programs based on finite-state models of them
  The work received the Turing Award
- The program Verification problem is generally undeciable, but it is decidable over finite state machines
