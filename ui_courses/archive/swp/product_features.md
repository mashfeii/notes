# What features will your app have?

Closely related term - minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with **just enough** features **to be usable** by early customers who can then _provide feedback_ for the future product development.

> What is the simplest possible version of my product that will have value for my user?
> Such question should break the whole, probably, comprehensive project into steps

So, the waterfall approach makes the project step by step, like wheels → body → wheel of the car.
Agile method makes iterative **viable** steps: skateboard → scooter → bicycle → bike → car, where on each step requirements are again analyzing, prioritizing and so on.

## Breaking down the functionality

- Narrow the problem
- Specify the features (use case diagrams)
- Prioritize the features (what can be implemented first, second and so on)
