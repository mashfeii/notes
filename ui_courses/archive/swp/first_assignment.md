## Dealing with customer

- Have the first meeting asap (online/offline)
- Establish regular meetings
- Show what you have to get feedback
- Concentrate on what and why, not how
- be tactful and professional

> **What features will your product/service have?**
> A minimum viable product is a version of a product with _just enough_ features _to be usable_
> by the customer who can then provide feedback for future development

### Breaking down the functionality into phases

- Narrow down the problem

> If you are not embarrassed of your MVP, you launched too late

## Agile principles

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through _early_ and _continuous_ delivery of _valuable_ software.
Welcome to changing requirements, even late in development.
