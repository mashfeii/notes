# Introduction to the SWP course

- **Requirements** are concerned solely with phenomena in the world. Our customers want us to
  engineer effects in the world, not in the machine
- **Programs**, by contrast, are concerned solely with the machine phenomena. Their purpose is to
  describe those properties and behaviors of the machine that will, ultimately, satisfy the
  customers
- The gap between the two is bridged by **specification**

### Requirements Engineering

Gather requirements → Analyze requirements → Define requirements → Prioritize requirements →
Validate and maintain

## Preparing to the interview - question generation

1. What are the deadlines and budget?
   -- Can be taken from auditory (in task was discussed)
2. Which platform do you prefer to connect with application (desktop, web, messenger, etc.)
3. What type of questions should the application support? (open, choice, close, audio, video)
4. Types of interaction with questions (manual input, parsing of the data of the material passed,
   etc.)
   -- Too general
5. Output of results, saving previous ones, statistics by groups, course, etc.

## Text redactors/IDE

Vim/Neovim:

- Lightweight always (10/10)
- Fast (10/10)
- Expandable (8/10)
- Easy Configurable (8/10)

VS Code:

- Fast (6/10, depends on number of plugins)
- Lightweight (6/10, plugins after installation make it more like IDE)
- Easier to configure (numerous number of plugins) (10/10)

JetBrains products:

- Ready out-of-the-box (10/10)
- Heavy, but has all the functionality, you need (8/10 for heaviness)

| Indicator     | Vim/Neovim | VS Code                                | JetBrains                          |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Speed         | 10         | 6 (depends a lot on amount of plugins) | 8 (depends on machine performance) |
| Weight        | 10         | 8 (again plugins)                      | 4 (out-of-the-box decision)        |
| Configuration | 6          | 10                                     | 4 (no need)                        |
