# Scrum is

_a framework_ for organizing and managing work that based on:

- a set of values
- principles
- and practices

that provide the foundation to implement tasks in agile way

![Scrum Framework overview](../../attachments/scrum-overview.png)

## Product owner

Empowered _central point_ of product leadership, _single authority_ responsible for deciding:

- which features and functionality to build
- the order in which to build them

Provide clear vision of the product.
_Responsible for the overall success_ of the solution being developed or maintained

## Scrum Master

Helps to understand and embrace the Scrum values, principles and practices
Acts as a _coach, leader_ (not as a manager)

- helps the organization through the challenging change management process
- helps to resolve issues and make improvements
- protecting the team from outside interference
- takes a leadership role in removing impediments

## Development Team

- Cross-functional, combine roles of architect, programmer, tester, database administrator, UI
  designer, and so on
- Responsible for designing, building, and testing the desired product
- Self-organized (typically five to nine people in size)

## Sprint Cycle

1. Sprint planning
   - The sprint goal summarizes the business purpose and value of the sprint
   - The product owner should come to Sprint planning with an initial Sprint goal
   - That initial goal, however, can be refined during the course of planning as the participants
     work together to determine what can realistically be delivered
2. Sprint execution
3. Sprint review
4. Sprint retrospective

### Sprint Review

- inspect and adapt what has been built so far
- transparent look at the current state of the product
- ask questions
- make observations or suggestions
- have discussions about how to best move forward

#### Summarize

The Sprint review kicks off with a Scrum team member (frequently the _product owner_)

- presenting the Sprint goal
- the product backlog items associated with the Sprint goal
- an overview of the product increment that was actually achieved during the Sprint

If the results **do not** match, the Scrum team provides an explanation

- it is important for the Sprint review to be a blame-free environment
- the purpose of the review is to describe what was accomplished and then to _use the information to
  determine the best course of action for moving forward_

#### Demonstrate

Although a demonstration is quite helpful in the Sprint review, it is not the aim of the Sprint
Review
The most important aspect of the review is **_in-depth conversation_** and **_collaboration_**
among the participants
Nothing provides focus to the conversation like being able to actually see how something works

### Development process visualization

- _Fixed scope of tasks_ - how many sprints do we need to complete all the tasks scheduled for
  release?
- _Fixed time_ - how much time we will complete the tasks for the release (for a limited number of
  sprints)

## PBI Estimation Units

- **Story Points** - measure the _magnitude of a PBI_. SPs combine factors like complexity and
  physical size into one relative size measure (big != complex && small != easy)
- **Ideal Days** - represent the number of person-days needed to complete a story (_the risk of
  misinterpretation_): **_Ideal time != elapsed time_**

## Rules for the game
