# Server Documentation

The main thing is: incorrect/outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.
You must provide correct documentation if you want someone else to use your API.
There are two types to write it:

- Manual: just write it in markdown
- Auto generated: swagger, OpenAPI, etc.
