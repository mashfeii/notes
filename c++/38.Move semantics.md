## Move semantics and rvalue-reference

Move operations are made for optimization copying temporary objects for avoiding
redundant copy of temporary object.

Move operations are called from `rvalue` objects, copy - from `lvalue`

### Move constructor

Object based on which new object is created in move constructor do not become
invalid, instead it still can be used by someone, so one need to explicitly say
that parameter object in empty (`string&& other` in next example).

> [!NOTE]- Rule of FIVE
> If one implements non-trivial constructor, he should also implement copy,
> assign-copy, move, assign-copy, default constructors or make them default

> [!IMPORTANT]- Non-copying, but moving types
> Example of such type is `std::unique_ptr`, it is a smart pointer, that can not
> be copied, only moved to another place

## Mystic function `std::move`

This function makes explicit cast to rvalue - [naive implementation](./move_implementation.cpp)
it does not move something to somewhere, instead it more like "`rvalue_cast`"
