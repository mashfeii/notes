## Avoiding overloading for different reference types

Since C++11, code style recommends to not make overload for `const T&` and `T&&`
respectively, but make one function with parameter by value `f(T x)` for such
cases, when all possible parameter types support move operation and parameter, and it is assumed that parameter will be passed on for further work.
