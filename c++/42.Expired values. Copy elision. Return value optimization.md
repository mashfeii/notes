Interesting [example](./overloading_example.cpp) function overloading for different value types.

`std::exchange` - function, that efficiently (move if can or copy) replaces the value of two given objects, returns the value of "old" object
`std::move_iterator` - iterator adapter which behaves exactly like the
underlying iterator, except that dereferencing converts the value into a
rvalue.

Since C++11 categories of values were expanded:

- lvalue → glvalue (generalized)
- xlvalue (expired) → glvalue
- prvalue (pure) → rvalue

In the following example executes only one constructor, since string initialized
from **pure rvalue**, in case with `std::move` string initialized from (expired)
xvalue, so, two constructors are called:

```cpp
std::string s = std::string("abc");
// but with ... s = std::move(std::string("abc")); 2 constructor will be called
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lvalue must be placed somewhere in memory, While rvalue can be computed in
> runtime by compiler.

## Temporary materialization

A _prvalue_ of any complete type `T` can be converted to a _xvalue_ of the same
type `T`. This conversion initializes a **temporary object** of type `T` from
the _prvalue_ by evaluating the _prvalue_ with the temporary object as its
result object, and produces a _xvalue_ denoting the temporary object.

## Return value optimization

When one returns a local variable from function by value (it can be a normal
local variable or parameter) it is moved into return place. Additionally, when
returning an object by value, it is created in `return` place.
